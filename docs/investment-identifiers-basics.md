## Basics of Investment Identifiers

Investment identifiers are standardized codes used to uniquely identify financial instruments such as stocks, bonds, derivatives, and other securities. These identifiers serve critical functions in:

- **Trade clearing and settlement**: Ensuring the correct security is bought/sold
- **Regulatory reporting**: Meeting compliance requirements across jurisdictions
- **Risk management**: Accurately tracking positions and exposures
- **Reference data management**: Maintaining consistent security information across systems
- **Cross-border transactions**: Facilitating international trading and custody

### The Fragmented Landscape

The securities identification landscape is **highly fragmented**, with different identifiers serving different geographic regions, asset classes, and historical contexts. This fragmentation stems from:

1. **Historical development**: Different markets developed their own systems before globalization
2. **Regional regulatory requirements**: Each jurisdiction may mandate specific identifiers
3. **Commercial interests**: Some identifiers are proprietary and generate licensing revenue
4. **Competing standards**: Multiple organizations claim to offer "universal" solutions

---

## The "Golden Identifier" Question

### Is There a Universal Unique Key?

**Short answer**: No single identifier currently serves as a perfect "golden identifier" across all markets and use cases.

**Closest candidate**: **FIGI (Financial Instrument Global Identifier)** comes closest to the ideal of a universal identifier, but adoption is still evolving.

### Why FIGI Is the Strongest Candidate

**Advantages:**
- **Comprehensive coverage**: Over 300 million securities across all asset classes (far exceeding ISIN's ~26 million)
- **Exchange-level granularity**: Unlike ISIN, FIGI identifies securities at the exchange level
- **Open standard**: Free to use under MIT license, no licensing fees (unlike CUSIP-based ISINs)
- **Stability**: Randomly assigned with no semantic meaning; doesn't change due to corporate actions
- **Regulatory momentum**: In August 2024, nine US regulators (including Fed, SEC, CFTC) proposed requiring FIGI for regulatory reporting under the Financial Data Transparency Act (FDTA)

**Current limitations:**
- **Not yet universally adopted**: Many legacy systems still rely on ISIN, CUSIP, or SEDOL
- **Relatively new**: First released in 2014; lacks the decades of entrenchment enjoyed by ISIN/CUSIP
- **Bloomberg connection**: While open, FIGI is managed by Bloomberg, raising potential governance concerns

### The Compromises We Must Make

Since no true golden identifier exists today, systems dealing with security identification must accept several compromises:

#### 1. **Multi-Identifier Strategy**
Most production systems maintain **multiple identifiers** for each security:
- Primary key might be an internal UUID
- Foreign keys to ISIN, CUSIP, SEDOL, FIGI, and ticker/exchange pairs
- This redundancy ensures maximum interoperability but increases data management complexity

#### 2. **Context-Dependent Identification**
Which identifier to use depends on:
- **Geographic region**: CUSIP in North America, ISIN in Europe, SEDOL in UK
- **Asset class**: Some identifiers work better for equities vs. bonds vs. derivatives
- **Use case**: Trading (tickers), settlement (ISIN), regulatory reporting (increasingly FIGI)

#### 3. **Non-Deterministic Mapping**
**Critical limitation**: There is **no algorithmic conversion** between identifier types. You cannot calculate an ISIN from a ticker or vice versa. This requires:
- **Lookup databases**: Maintain comprehensive cross-reference tables
- **API services**: Use commercial services (Bloomberg, Reuters) or open ones (OpenFIGI)
- **Data quality issues**: Mappings can be stale, incomplete, or contradictory across sources

#### 4. **One-to-Many and Many-to-Many Relationships**

**ISIN → Multiple Tickers:**
- A single security (one ISIN) may trade on multiple exchanges with different ticker symbols
- Example: A European company might have different tickers on Frankfurt, Paris, and London exchanges
- Same ISIN, but different tickers, different currencies, and different prices

**Ticker → Multiple Securities:**
- The same ticker can represent different securities on different exchanges
- Example: "IAU" = Intrepid Mines on TSX, but iShares Gold Trust on US exchanges
- Tickers alone are **insufficient as unique identifiers** without exchange context

**Solution**: Use composite identifiers like `TICKER:MIC` (ticker + Market Identifier Code)

#### 5. **Temporal Validity**
Identifiers may:
- **Change over time**: Corporate actions (mergers, splits) may invalidate mappings
- **Become inactive**: Delisted securities retain their identifier but become stale
- **Have delayed assignment**: New issues may not immediately have all identifier types

#### 6. **Partial Coverage**
No single identifier covers:
- **All asset classes**: Some systems exclude certain derivatives, structured products, or OTC instruments
- **All markets**: Emerging markets may have incomplete identifier assignment
- **Historical data**: Older securities may lack newer identifier types like FIGI

## Identifier Details

### FIGI (Financial Instrument Global Identifier)

#### What It Identifies
A 12-character alphanumeric identifier designed to uniquely identify **any financial instrument at the trading venue level**. Unlike ISIN (which identifies the same security across all exchanges), FIGI provides a **distinct identifier for each listing** on each exchange, making it the most granular of the major identifiers.

#### Structure
```
BBG000BLNNH6
│││        └─ Check digit (1 char)
│││          └─ Randomly assigned identifier (8 chars)
││└──────────── Always 'G' designating "Global" identifier (1 char)
└└───────────── Certified Provider code (2 chars, typically "BB" for Bloomberg)
```

**Components:**
1. **Provider code** (2 chars): Identifies the Certified Provider that issued the FIGI (Bloomberg = "BB")
2. **Global indicator** (1 char): Always 'G' to designate this as a Global Identifier
3. **Random ID** (8 chars): Randomly generated alphanumeric string with no semantic meaning
4. **Check digit** (1 char): Modulus 10 Double Add Double algorithm for validation

**Key design principle**: The FIGI itself contains **no embedded information** about the instrument. All meaningful data (ticker, exchange, issuer, asset type, etc.) is captured in **metadata** associated with the FIGI.

**FIGI hierarchy**:
- **Share-Class FIGI**: Identifies the security at the global level (similar to ISIN scope)
- **Trading-Venue FIGI**: Identifies a specific listing on a specific exchange (most granular)
- **Composite FIGI**: Represents aggregated data from multiple venues

#### Where Used

**Geographic prevalence:**
- **United States**: Rapidly gaining adoption, especially in regulatory contexts
  - **August 2024**: Nine US regulators (Fed, SEC, CFTC, OCC, FDIC, FHFA, NCUA, CFPB, FCA) proposed mandating FIGI for Financial Data Transparency Act (FDTA) reporting
- **Global**: Over 300 million FIGIs issued covering instruments in markets worldwide
- **Hong Kong**: Approved for use in OTC derivatives reporting (Sept 2024)
- **Australia**: Accepted for regulatory reporting
- **Europe**: Growing usage, though ISIN remains dominant for regulatory purposes

**Asset classes:**
- Comprehensive: equities, bonds, derivatives, futures, options, currencies, mortgage products, structured products, funds, ETFs
- One of the few identifiers explicitly designed to cover **all** financial instrument types

**Usage:**
- Regulatory reporting (especially in US)
- Reference data management and symbology mapping
- Market data aggregation across venues
- Risk management and portfolio analytics
- Increasingly adopted by fintech platforms and APIs

#### Standards and Variations

**Single standard**: Maintained by Object Management Group (OMG), ISO-level standard
- **OMG Specification**: FIGI is an OMG standard, giving it governance similar to ISO
- **No version variations**: Consistent 12-character format since inception
- **Open standard**: Unlike CUSIP, FIGI is fully open-source
- **MIT License**: Free to use, no licensing fees, no usage restrictions

**Administration:**
- **Registration Authority**: Bloomberg L.P. (designated by OMG)
- **Certified Providers**: Currently Bloomberg is the primary provider, but the standard allows for additional providers
- **OpenFIGI**: Bloomberg provides free API and tools at openfigi.com for lookups and mapping

**Historical context:**
- **Released**: 2014 (relatively new compared to ISIN's 1981 or CUSIP's 1964)
- **Purpose**: Address fragmentation and licensing costs of existing identifiers
- **Design goal**: Create a truly universal, free, stable identifier

**Stability commitment**: Once assigned, a FIGI is **never reused** and represents the same instrument in perpetuity, even after delisting or expiration.

#### Trends

**Status**: **Rapidly gaining adoption**, especially in US regulatory and fintech sectors

**Strong momentum:**
- **FDTA proposal (2024)**: Strongest regulatory endorsement yet; would make FIGI mandatory for US regulatory reporting
- **Free and open**: Zero-cost model is highly attractive vs. CUSIP licensing fees
- **API-first**: OpenFIGI provides modern REST API, making it developer-friendly
- **Fintech adoption**: New platforms favor FIGI over legacy identifiers
- **300M+ coverage**: Largest identifier database, covering instruments that lack ISIN or CUSIP

**Current limitations:**
- **Still emerging**: Many legacy systems not yet integrated with FIGI
- **Lower awareness**: Less well-known among traditional finance professionals than ISIN/CUSIP
- **Bloomberg association**: Some perceive governance risk due to Bloomberg management (though standard is open)
- **Incomplete historical data**: As a newer system, historical securities may lack FIGIs

#### SWOT Analysis

**Strengths:**
- ✅ **Free and open**: MIT license, no licensing fees (major advantage over CUSIP)
- ✅ **Exchange-level granularity**: Distinguishes between same security on different venues (ISIN doesn't)
- ✅ **Comprehensive coverage**: 300M+ instruments across all asset classes (10x+ more than ISIN)
- ✅ **Stable by design**: Randomly generated, no semantic meaning, never changes due to corporate actions
- ✅ **Modern architecture**: Separates identifier from metadata; API-first approach
- ✅ **Never reused**: FIGI is permanent, even for delisted/expired instruments
- ✅ **Regulatory momentum**: US FDTA proposal gives strong validation
- ✅ **No geographic bias**: Truly global from inception (not retrofitted like ISIN)
- ✅ **Includes non-listed instruments**: Covers OTC, private securities, and exotics that lack ISIN
- ✅ **OMG governance**: Standard managed by independent standards body

**Weaknesses:**
- ❌ **Relatively new**: Only 10 years old (2014); lacks decades of entrenchment
- ❌ **Lower market penetration**: Many systems still don't support FIGI natively
- ❌ **Bloomberg dependency**: While open, Bloomberg is currently the sole Registration Authority
- ❌ **Awareness gap**: Less familiar to traditional finance professionals
- ❌ **EU not mandating**: Europe still heavily favors ISIN for regulatory purposes
- ❌ **No algorithmic conversion**: Like other identifiers, requires lookup for cross-referencing
- ❌ **Metadata dependency**: FIGI alone tells you nothing; must fetch associated metadata

**Opportunities:**
- 🔄 **FDTA implementation**: If US regulators mandate FIGI, adoption will skyrocket
- 🔄 **Cost-conscious migration**: Firms seeking to avoid CUSIP fees may adopt FIGI
- 🔄 **API economy**: Modern API-first approach aligns with fintech and cloud-native architectures
- 🔄 **OpenFIGI ecosystem**: Free tools lower barrier to adoption
- 🔄 **Multi-venue trading growth**: Increased fragmentation across venues benefits granular identifiers

**Threats:**
- ⚠️ **Inertia**: Switching costs and legacy system integration may slow adoption
- ⚠️ **ISIN entrenchment**: EU and global regulatory preference for ISIN is hard to displace
- ⚠️ **Governance concerns**: Bloomberg control may raise concerns about neutrality or continuity
- ⚠️ **Competing standards**: Other identifiers (ISIN, CUSIP) are not going away; fragmentation persists
- ⚠️ **Regulatory uncertainty**: FDTA proposal is not yet finalized; could be weakened or delayed

**Key awareness points:**
- **Exchange specificity**: FIGI for Apple on NASDAQ ≠ FIGI for Apple on London Exchange (contrast with ISIN, which would be the same)
- **Composite FIGIs**: For aggregated market data, use Composite FIGI to get consolidated view across exchanges
- **Free API**: OpenFIGI provides free lookups and cross-reference mappings (no license required)
- **Metadata is essential**: FIGI alone is just a string; you must fetch metadata to get ticker, name, exchange, etc.
- **Historical assignment**: Older securities may not have FIGIs until requested; not all pre-2014 instruments are covered
- **Permanent assignment**: Unlike tickers (which can be reassigned), a FIGI is never reused for a different instrument

### ISIN (International Securities Identification Number)

#### What It Identifies
A globally recognized 12-character alphanumeric code that identifies a specific **security** (not a listing). The same security trading on multiple exchanges has the **same ISIN** regardless of where it trades.

#### Structure
```
US 0378331005
│  │         └─ Check digit (1 digit)
│  └─────────── National Securities Identifying Number/NSIN (9 digits)
└────────────── ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 country code (2 letters)
```

**Components:**
1. **Country code** (2 chars): ISO country code indicating the issuer's domicile (not where it trades)
2. **NSIN** (9 chars): National Securities Identifying Number, often based on local identifiers (e.g., CUSIP in US/Canada, padded with leading zeros if shorter)
3. **Check digit** (1 char): Modulus 10 algorithm for validation

**Special codes:**
- `XS`: International securities cleared through pan-European systems (Euroclear, Clearstream)
- Country-specific variations in NSIN administration

#### Where Used

**Geographic prevalence:**
- **Global**: Used in nearly 100 countries, particularly dominant in Europe
- **Europe**: Primary identifier; mandated by EU regulations (Solvency II Directive, MiFID II)
- **North America**: Used but secondary to CUSIP; ISINs in US/Canada are constructed from CUSIP codes
- **Asia-Pacific**: Varying adoption; managed by regional National Numbering Agencies (NNAs)

**Asset classes:**
- Equities, bonds, treasuries, commercial paper, medium-term notes, warrants, rights, trusts, futures, options, syndicated loans, and derivatives

#### Standards and Variations

**Single standard**: ISO 6166
- **No version variations**: The standard is stable and consistent globally
- **Regional administration**: Each country/region has a National Numbering Agency (NNA) that assigns ISINs
  - Examples: Telekurs (Switzerland uses Valor Numbers), HKEX (Hong Kong/China), SEBI (India), Bursa Malaysia

**Historical evolution:**
- First used: 1981
- Wide acceptance: 1989 (after G30 countries recommendation)
- EU mandated: 2004 (for regulatory reporting)

#### Trends

**Status**: **Stable and growing**, particularly due to regulatory mandates

**Gaining adoption:**
- European regulatory requirements continue to expand ISIN usage
- Increasingly required for global regulatory reporting
- Growing use in emerging markets as they integrate with global financial systems

**Challenges to dominance:**
- FIGI is being promoted by US regulators as an alternative/complement
- Does not provide exchange-level granularity (a limitation for some use cases)

#### SWOT Analysis

**Strengths:**
- ✅ Truly global standard (ISO 6166)
- ✅ Regulatory mandate in many jurisdictions (especially EU)
- ✅ Mature ecosystem with decades of adoption (since 1981)
- ✅ Identifies security independent of trading venue
- ✅ Built-in validation via check digit

**Weaknesses:**
- ❌ Does not identify the exchange/venue (same ISIN across all exchanges)
- ❌ Costly to obtain in North America (CUSIP licensing fees required)
- ❌ Based on national systems (NSIN), leading to inconsistencies
- ❌ Cannot algorithmically convert to/from other identifiers (requires lookup)
- ❌ Smaller coverage than FIGI (~26M vs 300M+ securities)

**Opportunities:**
- 🔄 Growing regulatory requirements worldwide
- 🔄 Increasing standardization in emerging markets
- 🔄 Integration with newer systems (FIGI can reference ISIN)

**Threats:**
- ⚠️ FIGI gaining regulatory support in US (FDTA proposal)
- ⚠️ Licensing costs may drive users to free alternatives
- ⚠️ Lack of exchange granularity is a limitation in multi-venue world

**Key awareness points:**
- **Same ISIN, different prices**: A security with one ISIN can have different prices on different exchanges (even accounting for currency)
- **Country code paradox**: The country code indicates issuer domicile, not trading location (a German company's ISIN starts with "DE" even when trading in New York)
- **Dependency on national systems**: Quality and timeliness of ISIN assignment depends on the local NNA

---

### Ticker Symbols

#### What They Identify
A short alphabetic or alphanumeric code representing a **specific listing** of a security on a **specific exchange**. Tickers are **not globally unique**—the same ticker can represent different securities on different exchanges.

#### Structure
**Highly variable** and exchange-dependent:
- **US exchanges**: 1-5 uppercase letters (e.g., `AAPL`, `MSFT`, `BRK.A`)
- **Other markets**: May include numbers, periods, or other characters
- **No standard format**: Each exchange defines its own conventions

**Composite identifier**: To uniquely identify a security, you need `TICKER:MIC` (ticker + Market Identifier Code)
- Example: `AAPL:XNAS` (Apple on NASDAQ) vs `AAPL:XLON` (if it traded in London)

#### Where Used

**Universal but not unique:**
- **Every exchange worldwide** assigns tickers to listed securities
- **Primary UI identifier**: Tickers are what traders, investors, and news media use colloquially
- **Not a regulatory identifier**: Too ambiguous for settlement, clearing, or official reporting

**Geographic conventions:**
- **North America**: 1-5 letters, historically 3 letters on NYSE, 4 on NASDAQ (conventions now mixed)
- **Europe**: Often includes numbers or special suffixes
- **Asia**: Commonly numeric (e.g., Hong Kong uses 4-digit numbers like `0700` for Tencent)

#### Standards and Variations

**No single standard**:
- ❌ No ISO standard for ticker symbols
- ❌ Each exchange independently assigns tickers
- ❌ No coordination between exchanges to avoid collisions

**Regional variations:**
- Different exchanges use different character sets, lengths, and conventions
- Some markets distinguish between share classes with suffixes (`.A`, `.B`) or other notations

**Historical reasons for fragmentation:**
- Exchanges developed independently as competing businesses
- Originally no need for global coordination (trading was local)
- Legacy of ticker tape machines (limited character sets)

#### Trends

**Status**: **Universal in usage, but increasingly supplemented**

**Persistent strengths:**
- Tickers remain the primary way humans reference securities
- Unlikely to disappear due to ubiquity in trading platforms, news, and conversation

**Adaptation:**
- Increasingly paired with MIC codes for programmatic use
- APIs and data feeds now commonly require both ticker and exchange identifier
- Market data vendors maintain symbology mapping services

#### SWOT Analysis

**Strengths:**
- ✅ **Human-readable and memorable** (much easier than alphanumeric codes)
- ✅ **Universal recognition** among traders and investors
- ✅ **Short and efficient** for displays and communication
- ✅ **Assigned quickly** by exchanges for new listings

**Weaknesses:**
- ❌ **Not globally unique** (same ticker on different exchanges)
- ❌ **No standard format** (every exchange has its own rules)
- ❌ **Can change** (ticker reassignments after mergers, spin-offs, or delisting)
- ❌ **Insufficient for settlement** (requires additional context)
- ❌ **One security, multiple tickers** (same stock on different exchanges has different tickers)
- ❌ **Ambiguous without exchange** (must use composite identifier TICKER:MIC)

**Opportunities:**
- 🔄 Composite identifiers (TICKER:MIC) gaining adoption in APIs
- 🔄 Can be mapped to other identifiers via symbology services

**Threats:**
- ⚠️ Confusion from duplicate tickers across exchanges
- ⚠️ Errors in systems that don't properly track exchange context
- ⚠️ Increasing complexity as securities trade on more venues

**Key awareness points:**
- **Never use tickers alone as a unique key**: Always pair with exchange/MIC code in databases
- **Display vs. storage**: Tickers are great for user interfaces but terrible for data integrity
- **Mapping is essential**: Any ticker-based system must maintain mappings to more robust identifiers (ISIN, FIGI, CUSIP)
- **Real-world collision examples**:
  - `IAU`: Intrepid Mines (TSX) vs. iShares Gold Trust (US)
  - `AFC`: Arsenal FC (ISDX) vs. AFC Energy (LSE)
- **No algorithmic conversion**: You cannot convert a ticker to an ISIN without a lookup database

---

### CUSIP (Committee on Uniform Security Identification Procedures)

#### What It Identifies
A 9-character alphanumeric code that uniquely identifies a specific **security issue** in the United States and Canada. Unlike tickers, CUSIPs are unique within North America and do not vary by exchange.

#### Structure
```
037833100 5
│        │ └─ Check digit (1 char)
│        └─── Issue identifier (2 chars)
└──────────── Issuer identifier (6 chars, "CUSIP-6")
```

**Components:**
1. **Issuer ID** (6 chars): Uniquely identifies the company/entity (called "CUSIP-6")
2. **Issue ID** (2 chars): Identifies the specific security type/issue for that issuer
3. **Check digit** (1 char): Modulus 10 checksum for validation

**Related system**: **CINS** (CUSIP International Numbering System)
- Same 9-character structure but first character is a letter indicating country/region
- Extends CUSIP approach to international securities

#### Where Used

**Geographic prevalence:**
- **United States and Canada**: Dominant identifier; effectively the national standard
- **Required by US regulators**: Mandated for clearing, settlement, and regulatory reporting in North America

**Asset classes:**
- Equities, corporate bonds, municipal bonds, government bonds, money market instruments
- Comprehensive coverage of US and Canadian securities

**Not used outside North America** (except via ISIN, where CUSIP forms the NSIN component)

#### Standards and Variations

**Single standard**: Maintained by CUSIP Global Services (CGS)
- **No version variations**: Consistent format since inception
- **Commercial system**: Owned by American Bankers Association (ABA), operated by FactSet Research Systems
- **Licensing required**: CUSIPs are proprietary; assignment and usage require fees

**Historical context:**
- Established: 1964 by the American Bankers Association
- Purpose: Standardize security identification in North American markets

#### Trends

**Status**: **Mature and entrenched** in North America, but facing open-standard competition

**Stable usage:**
- Remains mandatory for US/Canadian regulatory compliance
- Deeply embedded in North American financial infrastructure
- No signs of declining usage in its core market

**Challenges:**
- Cost structure (licensing fees) drives interest in free alternatives like FIGI
- US regulators proposing FIGI as preferred identifier (FDTA 2024 proposal)
- Limited to North America (not a global solution)

#### SWOT Analysis

**Strengths:**
- ✅ **Mandatory in North America**: Regulatory requirement ensures universal adoption in US/Canada
- ✅ **Unique within jurisdiction**: No ambiguity about which security is referenced
- ✅ **Mature infrastructure**: Decades of reliable operation (since 1964)
- ✅ **Issuer grouping**: CUSIP-6 allows easy identification of all securities from the same issuer
- ✅ **Check digit validation**: Built-in error detection

**Weaknesses:**
- ❌ **Proprietary and costly**: Licensing fees required (unlike open alternatives)
- ❌ **North America only**: Not used outside US/Canada (limits global interoperability)
- ❌ **Doesn't identify exchange**: Like ISIN, doesn't specify trading venue
- ❌ **Corporate action complexity**: May change or become invalid after mergers/restructurings

**Opportunities:**
- 🔄 CINS extends the system to international securities
- 🔄 Forms the basis of ISIN in North America (embedded in US/CA ISINs)

**Threats:**
- ⚠️ **FIGI competition**: Free, open alternative gaining regulatory favor (FDTA proposal)
- ⚠️ **Cost sensitivity**: Licensing fees drive users to seek alternatives
- ⚠️ **Geographic limitation**: Not a solution for truly global portfolios

**Key awareness points:**
- **Required for North American compliance**: Tax reporting, regulatory filings, and settlement all require CUSIP
- **ISIN dependency**: US and Canadian ISINs are directly constructed from CUSIPs (US + CUSIP + check digit)
- **Licensing implications**: Using CUSIP data in a product may require licensing agreements
- **CUSIP-6 as grouping key**: Useful for identifying all securities from the same issuer

### SEDOL (Stock Exchange Daily Official List)

#### What It Identifies
A 7-character alphanumeric code that uniquely identifies a **security** in the United Kingdom and Ireland. SEDOLs serve as the National Securities Identifying Number (NSIN) for UK/Irish ISINs.

#### Structure
```
B000009
│      └─ Check digit (1 char)
└──────── Alphanumeric identifier (6 chars)
```

**Components:**
1. **Base identifier** (6 chars): Alphanumeric code assigned sequentially
2. **Check digit** (1 char): Validation digit

**Evolution:**
- **Pre-2004**: Numeric only (6 digits + check digit)
- **Post-January 26, 2004**: Alphanumeric (letters and numbers), starting with `B000009`

#### Where Used

**Geographic prevalence:**
- **United Kingdom**: Primary identifier for LSE (London Stock Exchange)
- **Ireland**: Also uses SEDOL
- **International recognition**: SEDOL is often used as a preferred identifier for UK and Irish securities globally

**Asset classes:**
- Equities, investment trusts, insurance-based securities, bonds, and other securities listed in UK/Ireland

**Usage by market participants:**
- Asset managers, hedge funds, custodians, fund administrators, pension funds, brokers, dealers, regulators

#### Standards and Variations

**Single standard**: Maintained by the London Stock Exchange
- **Format change in 2004**: Transitioned from numeric-only to alphanumeric
- **Sequential assignment**: Codes assigned in order as requested by issuers
- **No regional variants**: Consistent format across all UK/Irish securities

**Administration:**
- Managed by London Stock Exchange Group (LSEG)
- Assignment on request by security issuer

#### Trends

**Status**: **Stable within UK/Ireland**, but geographically limited

**Current usage:**
- Entrenched as the primary identifier for UK and Irish securities
- No declining trend within its core market
- Stable demand due to London's role as a major financial center

**Limitations:**
- Not expanding beyond UK/Ireland
- Limited relevance outside of British/Irish securities
- Less prominent in global contexts where ISIN or FIGI are preferred

#### SWOT Analysis

**Strengths:**
- ✅ **Unique and stable**: Reliably identifies UK/Irish securities
- ✅ **Embedded in ISIN**: Forms the NSIN component of UK/Irish ISINs
- ✅ **Wide adoption**: Used globally for UK/Irish security identification (not just locally)
- ✅ **Enhances STP efficiency**: Reduces cross-border trade failures for UK securities
- ✅ **Data accuracy**: Consistent identifier improves data quality across systems

**Weaknesses:**
- ❌ **Geographic limitation**: Only covers UK and Ireland
- ❌ **Not a global solution**: Irrelevant for non-UK/Irish securities
- ❌ **Format change in 2004**: Legacy systems may still have numeric-only SEDOLs, requiring careful handling
- ❌ **Less prominent than ISIN/CUSIP**: Secondary to more global identifiers

**Opportunities:**
- 🔄 London remains a major financial center, ensuring continued relevance
- 🔄 Used as a global identifier for UK securities (not just locally)

**Threats:**
- ⚠️ Brexit impact on London's financial prominence could reduce relevance
- ⚠️ FIGI and ISIN provide broader geographic coverage for global portfolios
- ⚠️ Limited growth potential beyond current geographic scope

**Key awareness points:**
- **Post-2004 format change**: Be aware of legacy numeric SEDOLs vs. newer alphanumeric ones
- **UK/Irish ISIN component**: UK and Irish ISINs are constructed as `GB + SEDOL + check digit`
- **Global usage for UK securities**: Even non-UK investors use SEDOL when dealing with UK/Irish stocks
- **Preferred for UK shares**: Often more reliable than tickers for UK securities in global systems

## Other Important Identifiers

### FIGI (Financial Instrument Global Identifier)

**What it is**: An open-standard, 12-character alphanumeric identifier designed to be the universal solution for identifying financial instruments globally.

**Key characteristics:**
- **Open and free**: MIT license, no cost to use (unlike CUSIP)
- **Comprehensive**: 300M+ securities across all asset classes (far exceeds ISIN's ~26M)
- **Exchange-level granularity**: Identifies securities at the venue level (unlike ISIN)
- **Stable**: Randomly generated; doesn't change due to corporate actions
- **Managed by Bloomberg**: Designated as Registration Authority by Object Management Group (OMG)

**Regulatory momentum**:
- **August 2024**: Nine US regulators (Fed, SEC, CFTC, etc.) proposed mandating FIGI for Financial Data Transparency Act (FDTA) reporting
- Gaining acceptance in Hong Kong, Australia, and other jurisdictions

**Structure**:
```
BBG000BLNNH6
│││        └─ Check digit
│││          └─ Randomly assigned ID (8 chars)
││└──────────── Always 'G' (Global Identifier)
└└───────────── Certified Provider code (2 chars, e.g., "BB" for Bloomberg)
```

**Current status**: Emerging as the most credible candidate for a "golden identifier," but still in the adoption phase.

### MIC (Market Identifier Code)

**What it is**: A 4-character code (ISO 10383) that identifies specific **exchanges** or trading venues.

**Purpose**: Complements security identifiers by specifying **where** a security trades.

**Usage**:
- Paired with tickers to form composite identifiers: `TICKER:MIC` (e.g., `AAPL:XNAS`)
- Used in trade reporting and order routing
- Critical for disambiguating which exchange/venue is involved

**Types**:
- **Operating MIC**: Main operator (e.g., `XNYS` for NYSE)
- **Segment MIC**: Specific trading segment (e.g., `ARCX` for NYSE Arca)

**Examples**:
- `XNAS`: NASDAQ
- `XNYS`: New York Stock Exchange
- `XLON`: London Stock Exchange

**Administration**: Managed by SWIFT as the ISO 10383 Registration Authority (free of charge).

### LEI (Legal Entity Identifier)

**What it is**: A 20-character alphanumeric code that uniquely identifies **legal entities** (companies, institutions) rather than securities.

**Purpose**:
- Identifies the **issuer** or **counterparty**, not the instrument
- Used for regulatory reporting to track which legal entities are involved in transactions
- Complements security identifiers (ISIN, CUSIP, etc.)

**Not a security identifier**: LEI identifies organizations, not financial instruments, so it's outside the scope of our ISIN/Ticker translation focus.

---

## Mapping and Conversion Challenges

### The Core Problem

**No algorithmic conversion exists** between identifier types. You cannot calculate an ISIN from a ticker, or vice versa. All conversions require **lookup databases** or **API services**.

### One-to-Many Relationships

1. **ISIN → Multiple Tickers**
   - A single security (one ISIN) can trade on multiple exchanges with different tickers
   - Example: A European stock might have different tickers on Frankfurt, Paris, and London exchanges
   - **Same ISIN, different prices** (even after currency conversion) due to liquidity and market dynamics

2. **Ticker → Multiple ISINs** (when not paired with exchange)
   - The same ticker on different exchanges can represent entirely different securities
   - Example: `IAU` = Intrepid Mines (Canada) vs. iShares Gold Trust (US)
   - **Solution**: Always use `TICKER:MIC` composite identifiers

### Data Quality Challenges

1. **Incomplete coverage**: Not every security has all identifier types assigned
2. **Stale mappings**: Corporate actions (mergers, splits, ticker changes) can invalidate mappings
3. **Conflicting sources**: Different data providers may have different mappings for the same security
4. **Delayed assignment**: New issues may not immediately have ISIN, FIGI, or other identifiers

### Practical Solutions

1. **Use mapping APIs**:
   - **OpenFIGI**: Free API for FIGI and cross-identifier mapping
   - **Bloomberg/Reuters**: Commercial symbology services (expensive but comprehensive)
   - **Data vendors**: Refinitiv, FactSet, S&P Capital IQ maintain cross-reference databases

2. **Maintain redundant identifiers**:
   - Store multiple identifier types for each security in your database
   - Use internal UUID as primary key, with foreign keys to ISIN, CUSIP, SEDOL, FIGI, ticker/MIC

3. **Build and maintain mapping tables**:
   - Regularly refresh from authoritative sources
   - Track temporal validity (effective dates, corporate action history)
   - Handle null values (not all securities have all identifier types)

4. **Use composite identifiers where necessary**:
   - For tickers: Always include exchange (TICKER:MIC)
   - Consider including as-of date for time-sensitive applications

### Specific Challenges for ISIN ↔ Ticker Translation

Our primary focus area presents these specific challenges:

1. **ISIN does not specify exchange**:
   - One ISIN can map to multiple ticker/exchange pairs
   - Must decide: return all tickers? Return primary listing ticker? User-specified exchange?

2. **Ticker does not specify security uniquely**:
   - Must require users to also provide MIC (exchange code)
   - Even then, may need to disambiguate between instrument types (stock vs. option vs. warrant)

3. **No free, comprehensive, official mapping**:
   - ISIN.org and CUSIP Global Services do not provide free ticker mappings
   - OpenFIGI is the best free option, but may have gaps
   - Commercial solutions are expensive

4. **Regional biases in data sources**:
   - US-focused data sources have better coverage of NASDAQ/NYSE
   - European sources may have better coverage of LSE, Euronext, etc.
   - Need multiple sources for global coverage

5. **Ticker ambiguity even with exchange**:
   - Same ticker on same exchange may change over time (delisting and reuse)
   - Historical lookups require temporal validity tracking

## USA Trading Considerations

For systems focused exclusively on **US-traded securities** (stocks listed on US exchanges like NYSE, NASDAQ, etc.), the identifier landscape simplifies considerably but still presents important tradeoffs.

### Quick Comparison: US-Only Context

If you only need to deal with securities traded on US exchanges, here's how the identifiers stack up:

#### 1. **Ticker (+ Exchange MIC)**

**Verdict: Best for human interface, requires exchange context**

**Pros:**
- ✅ Universal recognition by US traders and investors
- ✅ Short, memorable, human-friendly
- ✅ Every US-listed security has one
- ✅ Primary way users think about and search for stocks

**Cons:**
- ❌ Not unique without exchange (though less problematic in US-only context)
- ❌ Can change over time (ticker reassignments)
- ❌ Ambiguous for securities with multiple listings (NYSE vs NASDAQ)
- ❌ Poor for programmatic/database use without additional context

**US-specific notes:**
- Most US stocks trade on a single primary exchange, reducing ambiguity vs. European multi-listing
- However, dual-listed stocks (e.g., Canadian companies on TSX + NYSE) still require exchange specification
- Best practice: Always use `TICKER:MIC` (e.g., `AAPL:XNAS`) even in US-only systems

#### 2. **CUSIP**

**Verdict: Best for regulatory compliance, costly**

**Pros:**
- ✅ **Mandatory for US regulatory compliance** (tax reporting, SEC filings, settlement)
- ✅ Unique within US/Canada (no ambiguity)
- ✅ Every US-listed security has one
- ✅ Stable and reliable
- ✅ Deeply integrated into US financial infrastructure

**Cons:**
- ❌ **Licensing fees required** (owned by ABA, operated by FactSet)
- ❌ Not free to use in commercial products
- ❌ Less human-readable than tickers
- ❌ Doesn't distinguish between exchanges (same CUSIP for all venues)

**US-specific notes:**
- If you need to file regulatory reports, submit to clearinghouses, or integrate with US custodians, CUSIP is often **non-negotiable**
- For internal-only systems or consumer-facing apps, the licensing cost may be prohibitive

#### 3. **ISIN**

**Verdict: Good for international interoperability, derivative of CUSIP in US**

**Pros:**
- ✅ Global standard (if you later expand beyond US)
- ✅ For US securities, it's just `US` + CUSIP + check digit (easy conversion)
- ✅ Unique and stable
- ✅ No additional licensing beyond CUSIP (since it's derived from CUSIP)

**Cons:**
- ❌ **Inherits CUSIP licensing costs** for US securities
- ❌ Less familiar to US retail investors than tickers
- ❌ Doesn't distinguish exchanges (same ISIN across all venues)
- ❌ Overkill if you're truly US-only forever

**US-specific notes:**
- US ISINs are mechanically generated: `US` + 9-character CUSIP + check digit
- If you have CUSIP, you can compute ISIN; if you have ISIN, you can extract CUSIP
- Good choice if you want to build a US-focused system but keep the door open for international expansion

#### 4. **FIGI**

**Verdict: Best for free, modern, exchange-aware systems**

**Pros:**
- ✅ **Free and open** (MIT license, no fees)
- ✅ **Exchange-level granularity** (unique FIGI for NYSE listing vs NASDAQ listing)
- ✅ Modern API-first approach (OpenFIGI REST API)
- ✅ Growing regulatory acceptance (FDTA 2024 proposal)
- ✅ Comprehensive coverage including OTC and exotics
- ✅ Stable (never changes due to corporate actions)

**Cons:**
- ❌ Less familiar to traditional US finance professionals
- ❌ Not yet mandatory (though proposed for US regulatory reporting)
- ❌ Newer system (2014), so less entrenched
- ❌ Some legacy systems may not support FIGI natively

**US-specific notes:**
- If you're building a **new system** and want to **avoid CUSIP licensing fees**, FIGI is the strongest alternative
- OpenFIGI provides free ticker ↔ FIGI ↔ ISIN mapping
- If FDTA passes as proposed (2024), FIGI will become de facto standard for US regulatory reporting

### Summary Table: US Trading Context

| Identifier | Cost | Uniqueness | Human-Friendly | Regulatory Status | Best For |
|------------|------|------------|----------------|-------------------|----------|
| **Ticker+MIC** | Free | Unique with MIC | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ | Not accepted | UI/UX, user input |
| **CUSIP** | 💰 Licensed | Unique in US/CA | ⭐⭐ | **Required** | Compliance, settlement |
| **ISIN** | 💰 Licensed (via CUSIP) | Unique globally | ⭐⭐ | Accepted | Global interoperability |
| **FIGI** | Free | Unique per venue | ⭐⭐ | Proposed (FDTA) | Modern APIs, cost-conscious |

### Recommended Approach for US-Only Systems

**Multi-identifier strategy** (even in US-only context):
1. **Primary database key**: Internal UUID (never expose externally)
2. **User-facing**: Ticker (+ exchange for disambiguation)
3. **Internal resolution**: FIGI (free, stable, venue-aware)
4. **Regulatory/settlement**: CUSIP (if required by your use case)
5. **Future-proofing**: Store ISIN (enables future international expansion)

**Cost vs. compliance:**
- If you **don't need** to submit regulatory reports or integrate with clearinghouses: **Use FIGI + Tickers** (avoid CUSIP licensing)
- If you **do need** regulatory compliance: **CUSIP is mandatory**, and you get ISIN for free by derivation

### ISIN-Only Trading API: Constraints and Complications

Suppose your trading API **only accepts and returns ISINs** (common with some institutional brokers, especially those with European roots or multi-regional platforms).

#### a) Does ISIN-Only Reduce Available Securities vs. Ticker?

**Short answer: Possibly, but unlikely for mainstream US equities.**

**Coverage analysis:**

1. **Mainstream US stocks**: ✅ **Full coverage**
   - All US-listed stocks on major exchanges (NYSE, NASDAQ, AMEX) have ISINs
   - ISIN is derived from CUSIP, and CUSIP is mandatory for US listings
   - You will **not** lose access to Apple, Microsoft, Tesla, etc.

2. **OTC markets**: ⚠️ **Potential gaps**
   - **Pink Sheets / OTC Markets**: Some thinly-traded OTC securities may lack ISINs
   - However, most reasonably liquid OTC stocks do have CUSIPs → ISINs
   - This is a corner case; if your users are trading penny stocks or microcaps, check broker coverage

3. **Newly listed securities**: ⚠️ **Temporary delays**
   - IPOs and direct listings receive CUSIP/ISIN assignment shortly before or after listing
   - There may be a brief window (hours to days) where a brand-new listing lacks an ISIN in some databases
   - Institutional brokers usually have ISINs ready by trading day

4. **Exotic instruments**: ⚠️ **May lack ISINs**
   - Some structured products, warrants, or OTC derivatives might not have ISINs
   - However, FIGI would cover these (300M+ instruments vs. 26M ISINs)
   - If your broker's API is ISIN-only, they likely don't support these instruments anyway

5. **Historical/delisted securities**: ✅ **ISINs persist**
   - ISINs remain valid even after delisting (useful for historical analysis)

**Practical impact:**
- For **standard US equity trading** (S&P 500, Russell 2000, major NASDAQ stocks), ISIN-only API will have **100% coverage**
- For **edge cases** (OTC pink sheets, very new IPOs, exotic derivatives), you might encounter gaps
- If the broker offers it via ISIN-only API, it definitely has an ISIN—so no access loss from API design

**Verdict**: ✅ ISIN-only does **not** materially reduce tradeable securities for mainstream US equity trading.

#### b) Ticker → ISIN Translation for Order Placement: Complications

If your **users place orders via Ticker** but your **trading API requires ISIN**, you face a translation layer with several complications:

##### Complication 1: **One Ticker → Multiple ISINs (Multi-Listing)**

**Problem:**
- Some stocks trade on multiple US exchanges (e.g., dual-listed on NYSE and NASDAQ, or primary + regional exchanges)
- Same ticker, but potentially different ISINs? No—actually, **same ISIN** because ISIN doesn't distinguish exchanges.

**Wait, this is actually OK:**
- ISIN identifies the **security**, not the listing
- User says "buy AAPL" → You resolve to ISIN `US0378331005` → Broker handles routing to best exchange
- **This complication is a non-issue** because ISIN's lack of exchange-specificity actually helps here

**Exception: Canadian dual-listings:**
- Stock trading on both TSX (Canada) and NYSE (US) will have **two different ISINs** (one Canadian `CA...`, one US `US...`)
- Example: Canadian company with `XYZ` ticker on both TSX and NYSE
- **Mitigation**: When user enters ticker, prompt for exchange or default to US exchange for US-focused app

##### Complication 2: **Same Ticker → Different Companies (Cross-Exchange Collision)**

**Problem:**
- Same ticker on different exchanges might represent different companies
- Example: `IAU` = Intrepid Mines (TSX) vs. iShares Gold Trust (US)
- If user says "buy IAU", which security do they mean?

**Mitigation:**
- **Require exchange selection**: Always ask user to specify exchange, either explicitly or via default
- **US default assumption**: If you're US-only, default to US exchanges (NASDAQ, NYSE, AMEX)
- **Display company name**: Before order confirmation, show company name + exchange to catch errors
- **Historical orders**: If user previously traded a ticker, assume they mean the same exchange

**Best practice:**
```
User input: "AAPL"
→ Resolve to: "AAPL on NASDAQ (XNAS)" → ISIN US0378331005
→ Confirm with user: "Buy Apple Inc. (AAPL) - NASDAQ"
```

##### Complication 3: **Ticker → ISIN Lookup Failures**

**Problem:**
- User enters a ticker that doesn't map cleanly to an ISIN
- Possible causes:
  - Typo (`APPL` instead of `AAPL`)
  - Very new listing (ISIN not yet in your mapping database)
  - Delisted stock (ISIN exists but broker no longer supports trading)
  - Ticker changed recently (company rebranded)

**Mitigation:**
- **Real-time symbology API**: Use OpenFIGI or similar to resolve ticker → ISIN at order time (don't rely solely on static database)
- **Fuzzy matching**: Suggest alternatives if exact match fails (`APPL` → "Did you mean AAPL - Apple Inc.?")
- **Cache with TTL**: Cache ticker→ISIN mappings but refresh daily/weekly to catch changes
- **Broker validation**: After ISIN lookup, validate with broker API that the ISIN is currently tradeable before showing order form

##### Complication 4: **Ticker Changes Over Time**

**Problem:**
- Company changes ticker symbol (e.g., Facebook `FB` → Meta `META`)
- User enters old ticker → Lookup fails or returns stale mapping

**Mitigation:**
- **Symbology database with historical mappings**: Maintain ticker change history
- **Corporate action tracking**: Subscribe to corporate action feeds (expensive) or use free sources (SEC filings, exchange announcements)
- **User education**: Display message like "Ticker changed: FB is now META"
- **Order preview**: Always show company name + current ticker before confirming order

##### Complication 5: **Share Classes and Suffixes**

**Problem:**
- Multiple share classes with suffix notation: `BRK.A` vs `BRK.B` (Berkshire Hathaway Class A vs Class B)
- Different ISINs: `US0846707026` (BRK.A) vs `US0846701086` (BRK.B)
- User might enter `BRK` without suffix → Which one do they mean?

**Mitigation:**
- **Exact match required**: If user enters `BRK`, prompt to specify `.A` or `.B`
- **Display share class**: Always show "Berkshire Hathaway Class A" vs "Class B" with price difference
- **Prevent ambiguity**: Don't auto-resolve to "most common" class—force user to choose

##### Complication 6: **Preferred Stocks, Warrants, and Units**

**Problem:**
- Ticker + suffix might indicate preferred stock (`XYZ-PA` = Series A Preferred), warrant (`XYZ.WS`), or unit (`XYZ.U`)
- Each has a different ISIN
- Suffix conventions vary by exchange

**Mitigation:**
- **Parse suffixes carefully**: Build rules for common patterns (`.WS`, `-PA`, `.U`)
- **Clearly label instrument type**: Show "XYZ Series A Preferred Stock" vs "XYZ Common Stock"
- **Filter by default**: If your users primarily trade common stock, default to showing only common (filter out preferreds/warrants)

##### Complication 7: **API Rate Limits and Latency**

**Problem:**
- Real-time ticker→ISIN lookup via external API (OpenFIGI, etc.) introduces latency
- Rate limits may throttle high-volume lookups
- User expects instant order placement; 500ms lookup delay is noticeable

**Mitigation:**
- **Aggressive caching**: Cache all ticker→ISIN mappings locally with daily refresh
- **Preload popular tickers**: Keep S&P 500 + NASDAQ 100 mappings always in memory
- **Asynchronous resolution**: Begin lookup as soon as user types ticker (autocomplete), not when they click "Buy"
- **Fallback static database**: If API is down, fall back to local database (even if slightly stale)

##### Complication 8: **User Confusion (UX Challenge)**

**Problem:**
- Users think in terms of tickers (`AAPL`, `TSLA`)
- ISINs are unfamiliar and intimidating (`US0378331005`)
- Exposing ISINs in UI creates cognitive load

**Mitigation:**
- **Hide ISIN from end users**: Accept ticker input, display ticker in UI, but translate silently behind the scenes
- **Order confirmation shows both**: "You're buying Apple Inc. (AAPL) [ISIN: US0378331005]" for transparency
- **Error messages in ticker language**: If ISIN lookup fails, say "Ticker AAPL could not be found" (not "ISIN resolution failed")

---

### Practical Implementation Pattern: Ticker-to-ISIN Order Flow

Here's a robust flow for handling user ticker input when your trading API requires ISIN:

```
1. User enters ticker: "AAPL"

2. Autocomplete / validation:
   - Query local cache: Is "AAPL" cached? Yes → US0378331005
   - If not cached: Call OpenFIGI API (ticker="AAPL", exchCode="US")
   - Return: ISIN US0378331005, Name "Apple Inc.", Exchange "NASDAQ"

3. Display to user:
   - Show: "Apple Inc. (AAPL) - NASDAQ - $150.25"
   - Hide ISIN in UI, but store in form data

4. User enters order details:
   - Quantity: 10 shares
   - Order type: Market

5. Order preview:
   - Show: "Buy 10 shares of Apple Inc. (AAPL)"
   - Small print: "ISIN: US0378331005 | Exchange: NASDAQ"
   - Confirmation required

6. Submit to broker API:
   - API call: { "isin": "US0378331005", "quantity": 10, "side": "buy", "type": "market" }
   - User never sees ISIN in primary flow

7. Order confirmation:
   - Show: "Order placed: Buy 10 AAPL at market"
   - Order ID, timestamp, estimated fill
```

**Key principles:**
- ✅ Accept ticker input (user-friendly)
- ✅ Resolve to ISIN behind the scenes (API requirement)
- ✅ Display ticker + company name (user context)
- ✅ Include ISIN in fine print (transparency + debugging)
- ✅ Cache aggressively (performance)
- ✅ Validate before submission (prevent errors)

---

### Summary: ISIN-Only API in US Trading Context

**Coverage impact:** ✅ Minimal—all mainstream US stocks have ISINs

**Translation complexity:** ⚠️ Moderate—requires:
- Real-time or cached symbology lookup service (OpenFIGI recommended)
- Exchange disambiguation (especially for dual-listed stocks)
- Corporate action tracking (ticker changes)
- Careful UX design (hide complexity from users)

**Recommended architecture:**
1. **Local symbology database**: Cache all major ticker→ISIN mappings (S&P 1500+)
2. **OpenFIGI API integration**: Fallback for lookups not in cache
3. **Daily refresh job**: Update cache from authoritative sources
4. **Exchange defaults**: US-only app should default to US exchanges (XNAS, XNYS)
5. **User confirmation**: Always confirm company name + exchange before submitting order
6. **Error handling**: Graceful failures with user-friendly messages in ticker language

**Bottom line:** An ISIN-only trading API is **perfectly workable** for US equities, but requires a **robust ticker→ISIN translation layer** to maintain a good user experience. The translation adds complexity but is a solved problem with the right tooling (OpenFIGI) and architecture (caching + validation).

## Summary: Key Takeaways for the Ticksinator Project

### For ISIN ↔ Ticker Translation:

1. **Always require exchange context**: `TICKER:MIC` is the minimum for lookup
2. **Accept one-to-many**: One ISIN may return multiple ticker/exchange combinations
3. **Plan for external APIs**: We will likely need OpenFIGI or similar services
4. **Cache aggressively**: Mappings don't change frequently; caching reduces API costs
5. **Handle null/missing**: Not every ISIN has a ticker (e.g., bonds); not every ticker maps cleanly to ISIN
6. **Consider temporal validity**: Corporate actions mean mappings can change over time

### Identifier Priority for Our Use Case:

**For storage and internal keys:**
1. **FIGI** (if available) - most comprehensive, stable, and exchange-aware
2. **ISIN** - regulatory standard, widely available
3. **Composite TICKER:MIC** - human-readable, for display

**For API design:**
- Accept any of: ISIN, FIGI, or TICKER+MIC
- Always return all available identifiers in responses
- Clearly document which identifier type was used for the lookup

### Recommended Architecture:

- **Internal primary key**: UUID or similar (not dependent on external identifier)
- **Foreign keys**: ISIN, CUSIP (for US/CA), SEDOL (for UK/IE), FIGI, TICKER+MIC
- **Mapping table**: Separate entity for identifier cross-references with temporal validity
- **External data refresh**: Periodic updates from OpenFIGI and/or commercial sources
